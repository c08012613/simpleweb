        <p>
            Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
            Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
            And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
            Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
            And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
            And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
            By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;<br>
            But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br>
            Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<br>
            Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,<br>
            When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<br>
            So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
